# SecondProject
Personalized dashboard app ideally for family usage.
Uses two static API's to pull in Current News top story (News API) and Current Weather (Dark Sky API through Rapid API) for set location.

Uses Express and Heroku Postgres database to post/edit To-Do Lists and Grocery list.

Ideally would have had Socket.io for chat feature to communicate between users, but was unable to complete this feature (will be updating app to include).

Uses index.ejs to display page (connecting server.js) through Heroku.

Uses following modules: axios, dotenv, sequelize, body-parser, express, passport.
